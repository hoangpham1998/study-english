St. Nicholas was a real person.</p><p>A long time ago, a man named Marcus <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>occupied</strong> a house with his family. He was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>modest</strong>. He always told everybody he was the strongest man in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>province</strong>.</p><p>He worked hard, but he could barely <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>sustain</strong> his family. He wanted to save money and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>prosper</strong>. Still, he could never earn a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>penny</strong> more than he needed.</p><p>One day, Marcus made an agreement with a blacksmith. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blacksmith</strong> had a lot of work to do. But he couldn&rsquo;t do it all by himself. Marcus wanted to help him <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>forge</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>iron</strong>. The blacksmith agreed to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>compensate</strong> him with a lot of money.</p><p>In the same town, there was a man named Nicholas. At an early age, Nicholas started <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>preaching</strong>. But he also believed that he should be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>humble</strong> and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>charitable</strong>. He learned that helping people gave him even more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>satisfaction</strong> than preaching.</p><p>One day, Nicholas <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>encountered</strong> Marcus. Marcus told Nicholas about his agreement with the blacksmith. &ldquo; I worked hard for him,&rdquo; Marcus said, &ldquo; but a problem <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>arose</strong>. Even though I worked for him, he didn&rsquo;t pay me.&rdquo;</p><p>Nicholas wanted to help Marcus. That night, he went back to Marcus&rsquo;s house. He brought a bag of gold. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>exceeded</strong> the amount that Marcus needed. Nicholas climbed up a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>ladder</strong> and dropped the bag of gold down the chimney. Marcus thanked his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>benefactor</strong>.</p><p>Soon, people found out about Nicholas&rsquo;s gift. He became well known and loved. Even today, people still give secret gifts to children. And we say they are from St. Nicholas.</p>",

In the morning, the shepherd couldn&rsquo;t take his sheep out of his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>lodge</strong>. Instead, he had to feed them inside. He gave a small amount of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wheat</strong> to his own sheep. But he gave more of the food to the wild sheep.

If they did not get food, they played a trick on the home. For this reason, the activity is known as &ldquo;trick-or- treating.&rdquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>Shortly</strong> after people first began trick-or-treating, parents started sending their children to beg on that day. Housewives gave the children food if they performed a song or a dance. When people moved to America from all over the world, they brought this tradition with them. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>Inhabitants</strong> of villages started trick-or-treating in the early 1900s. In 1939 a children&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>publication</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acquainted</strong> the whole country with the tradition. It became very popular.</p><p>Today, trick-or-treaters are not begging for food, and they are not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>scared</strong> of souls. They just enjoy the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>thrill</strong> of dressing up like creatures and getting candy. Ghosts and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>skeletons</strong> are favorite costumes. But some children wear <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>fancy</strong> disguises, like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>pirates</strong>. They carry <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>flashlights</strong> instead of fires. In some places, children still perform songs or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>riddles</strong> to get candy. But most of the time, they just say &ldquo;Trick-or-Treat!&rdquo;</p>",

One <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>autumn </strong>day, I was sure I would make my parents proud. I bought a model rocket. After I put it together, I invited everybody to watch it. I wanted my brothers to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>envy </strong>my technical knowledge.

Now I see why you and Dad don&rsquo;t love me as much as them,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo; That&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; said my mom. &ldquo; See my fingers . . . each one is different.

The Spanish <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>noble</strong>, Francisco Pizarro, arrived in Peru in the 1500s. He found a group of people called the Incas. The Incas believed that their leader, Atahualpa, was both a king and a god. But Pizarro didn&rsquo;t agree.</p><p>&ldquo; It is a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sin </strong>for a man to think he is God!&rdquo; he said to Atahualpa.</p><p>Atahualpa thought Pizarro was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>insulting </strong>his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>heritage</strong>. He thought the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blonde </strong>Spanish men held <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>prejudices </strong>against the Incas. But Atahualpa was a kind man and didn&rsquo;t want to fight the Spaniards.

But after seeing the gold, he wanted all of Peru&rsquo;s gold. So he didn&rsquo;t leave the country.</p><p>The Spanish soldiers stayed in Peru and grabbed all the gold they could find. But the Inca people tricked the Spaniards. They mixed the gold with tin so that it was poor quality. They gave this gold to the Spaniards. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Meanwhile</strong>, they hid the good gold.

One day, Cory the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>caterpillar</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>emerged </strong>from a hole in the wall while Katie was playing in the living room.</p><p>&ldquo; Hey!&rdquo; Katie yelled. &ldquo; Do you want to play with me?&rdquo;</p><p>Cory was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>reluctant</strong>. He said, &ldquo; I&rsquo;d rather not play with you. I have several <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>handicaps</strong>. My body is very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>delicate</strong>. Your claws are as sharp as <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>hooks</strong>. You might cut me. Plus, I have no bones, not even a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>spine</strong>. You could easily hurt me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>swear </strong>that I won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Katie said.</p><p>&ldquo; No, I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he said again. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hopped </strong>from the wall, but Katie <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>pursued </strong>him.</p><p>Cory ran into the kitchen and into the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>cupboard</strong>, but Katie chased closely behind. Katie knocked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>appliances </strong>to the floor. Plates fell into the sink and broke in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>basin</strong>.</p><p>Then he ran into a bedroom. Some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>laundry </strong>was on the floor. Cory hid under a shirt, but Katie saw him. She jumped on the shirt. Her paws left <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>stains </strong>on the cloth, and her claws ripped the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>sleeves </strong>into <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>strips</strong>.</p><p>However, Cory escaped. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>utilized </strong>a small crack in the floor to hide. But Katie saw him.</p><p>&ldquo; Now you are trapped!&rdquo; said Katie.</p><p>Cory tried to avoid Katie&rsquo;s claws. He moved his body as far into the hole as possible. He didn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;d get out of the hole.</p><p>Just then, Katie&rsquo;s owner came home. She saw that the house was a mess. She took a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>broom </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>swung </strong>it at Katie. She chased Katie out of the house.</p><p>Cory was safe, and Katie was left outside because she didn&rsquo;t listen to the wishes of others.</p>",
