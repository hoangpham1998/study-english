I used to watch <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>carriages </strong>on the streets. They fascinated me. Then I got a job as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>junior</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>mechanic</strong>. My father <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>criticized </strong>me. He wanted me to run the farm. But I did not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>shift </strong>my plans.</p><p>Then I worked for the Detroit Auto Company. But I wanted to make cars using less <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>labor</strong>. That way, there would be fewer <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>expenses</strong>. I started the Ford Motor Company in 1903. At first, the company did not do well. But many people were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>betting </strong>on my success. I also had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>sincere</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aim </strong>to make a car that anybody could buy.</p><p>Then, in 1908,1 introduced the Model-T in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>formal </strong>ceremony. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>confirmed </strong>that I was right: it was possible to build a car my way!</p><p>The Model T <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>differed </strong>from other vehicles. Workers could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>attach </strong>different parts for cars or trucks. This saved time. One Model T could be put together in 93 minutes. All of them had the same <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>classic </strong>design. They were all the same size and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>height</strong>. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>prime </strong>reason for doing this was to save money.</p><p>Over 19 years, I sold over 15 million Model Ts. This sent a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>signal </strong>to other companies. People would buy cars to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>commute </strong>to work if the price was low enough.</p>",
