            "story": "<p>Among the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>multitude </strong>of stars in the universe, there are a couple that are of great importance to people on Earth. The sun, of course, is one of them. The other is known as Polaris, the North Star. Polaris is special because it is the only star that always appears to be in the same place in the sky. Therefore, Polaris is a great compass. When people in the northern hemisphere of Earth look toward Polaris, they can be certain that they are facing north. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>permanence </strong>of Polaris in the north sky has helped countless people find their destinations.</p><p>Before the invention of modern navigation tools, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mariners </strong>relied on Polaris. From the top of their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>hulls</strong>, sailors would look for Polaris to figure out their place at sea. They figured out the angle between the star and the horizon to determine their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>latitude</strong>. As long as the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>equations </strong>weren&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>erroneous</strong>, the results were very reliable. Polaris also let sailors determine North, South, East, and West. By knowing directions and their location, mariners could easily navigate their ships.</p><p>To those who sail at night, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>volatile </strong>storms and dark clouds were more than <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>nuisances</strong>. They could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>disrupt </strong>entire journeys by blocking the view of Polaris. A captain could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>err </strong>and make an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>inadvertent </strong>wrong turn. The ship could become <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>stranded </strong>at sea, and the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>frantic </strong>captain would have no way to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>improvise </strong>to get the ship back on the right course. The mariner&rsquo;s fears wouldn&rsquo;t be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>soothed </strong>until the clouds cleared and Polaris came back into view. Even today, sailors sometimes opt to navigate by using Polaris on clear nights.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>differentiate </strong>Polaris from other stars. The Big Dipper, a constellation that is well known in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>astrology</strong>, appears to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>revolve </strong>around Polaris. The handle of the Big Dipper always points to the North Star. When people get lost, it&rsquo;s comforting to know that their problems can be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alleviated </strong>by looking at the sky.</p>",

Tim thought he was the best fossil hunter, while Dean was sure that he was much better than Tim.</p><p>One day, Tim was searching for fossils on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>periphery </strong>of the city when he discovered a huge bone.

As he dug, he uncovered more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>jagged </strong>bones. He realized that he had found an entire dinosaur <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>skeleton</strong>!

            "story": "<p>Once, a British <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>gazette </strong>had an unusual story. Scientists at a zoo made a discovery about komodo dragons. Komodo dragons are giant lizards that grow up to two and a half meters long. A female lizard at the zoo had babies. However, it had never been around a male lizard in its entire life. After the scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>publicized </strong>their discovery, many people thought it was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>fictitious</strong>.</p><p>But it was true. It was discovered that female komodo dragons can have babies without the help of their male <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>counterparts</strong>. This <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>contradicts </strong>what scientists know about how most animals have babies.</p><p>In most cases, there are many things that can <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>obstruct </strong>this type of reproduction. For example, adult males and females carry different genes needed to make an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>embryo</strong>. If the genes are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>homogeneous</strong>, the babies are weaker and have genetic problems. Over time, the weakened species dies out completely. This makes it necessary for the male to be involved. However, scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>verified </strong>that when Komodo babies are born, their genes aren&rsquo;t the exact same genes as their mother. Also, they are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>devoid </strong>of any genetic problems.</p><p>Scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>theorize </strong>that Komodo dragons developed the ability because it helps the species <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>fend </strong>off extinction. If a volcano erupts, lava can kill all of the komodo dragons on an island. However, as long as one female <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>eludes </strong>death, she can <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>prolong </strong>the survival of the species. Luckily, Komodo dragons are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vigorous </strong>swimmers. So the surviving female can <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>plunge </strong>into the ocean and swim to another island. When she comes <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>ashore</strong>, she can reproduce by herself. Over time, the genes within the population <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>diverge</strong>. Then, the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sparse </strong>population increases. Once again there is a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>surplus </strong>of lizards on one island. Scientists think that this may be how the lizards took over all of the islands in that area.</p>",

After many years, experts realized it contained a number of spells that varied greatly in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>scope</strong>.</p><p>The most common types of magic in the collection dealt with healing illnesses like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pneumonia</strong>. Some spells also gave advice for treating people with mental illnesses, such as those who became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>psychotic</strong>. Some spells asked for unusual things, like crocodile <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dung</strong>. But <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>botany </strong>was an important part of the magic. Many healing spells gave instructions on how to use herbs and plants that were believed to be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>therapeutic</strong>. For example, in order to cure <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>arthritis</strong>, the book says that the magician should build an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>ornate</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>altar</strong>. Then he should <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>mash </strong>different types of herbs and place them on top of it. At dusk, he is supposed to say a spell, so the gods would be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>gratified</strong>.</p><p>Other parts of the collection describe how to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>hone </strong>one&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>psychic </strong>abilities and how to give <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>credible </strong>descriptions of the future. Often, the book advised people how to use different objects to tell the future, including tea leaves. Also, one part of the book tells what different dreams might mean.

If the artery is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>ruptured</strong>, the victim will bleed to death.</p><p>In the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>mainstream</strong>, animal bites are seen as the most dangerous. But some scientists think this idea is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>invalid</strong>. In fact, the most dangerous bite might be the human bite. When scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>magnified </strong>the contents in human saliva, they found about three hundred different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>microbes </strong>in it. A human bite can be dangerous if the bacteria enters the body through a cut, which can make people very sick. Furthermore, most people don&rsquo;t realize how serious a man bit can be, so they don&#39;t go to the doctor right away. This gives the wound a chance to get infected and cause more problems.</p>",

His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>upbringing </strong>had taught him <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>consistency</strong>. He had done this job for years, and nothing could stop him. Besides, he thought nothing could hurt him.</p><p>Today, he had a very important task to do. The snow was starting to pile up high on the mountain. If too much <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accumulated</strong>, it could cause an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>avalanche</strong>. But Randy had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>apparatus </strong>to get rid of the snow. It used dynamite to shake the snow and make the top * layer of snow come down.</p><p>As the snow started falling, he thought about returning to the office until the storm stopped, but he decided not to. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise behind him. It was an avalanche! He started to run, but within seconds, he was knocked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sideways </strong>and buried by the snow and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>rubble</strong> from an old cabin that had been destroyed. An <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aerial </strong>rescue team came quickly.

Then he asked a wise member of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>senate </strong>who was visiting from Athens. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sage </strong>didn&rsquo;t say whether he should attack the Persians or not. He only warned him that his good luck wouldn&rsquo;t last.</p><p>Finally, King Croesus sent a messenger to visit the Oracle, a special lady who could see % the future.

Of those, nearly half died. At the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>onset </strong>of smallpox, people suffered from high fevers, headaches, vomiting, and aching muscles. Yet the worst symptom of all was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>intolerable</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>rash </strong>that caused irritation on the entire body. Those who survived the disease were often <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>rendered </strong>blind or left with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>gross</strong> scars on their face and body.</p><p>Today, however, cases of smallpox are very rare due to the work of many countries during the late 1900s. This <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>federation </strong>of countries <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>collaborated </strong>to completely destroy smallpox. Early in the century, wealthy countries in Europe and North America had developed a substance that made the body immune to smallpox. They had required all their citizens to get this vaccine to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>counteract </strong>the disease. Hence, the people of these countries no longer had to worry about smallpox.</p><p>However, many of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>needy </strong>people in poorer parts of the world still suffered from the disease. Their countries could not afford the vaccine nor supply enough doctors to curb the spread of smallpox.</p><p>In 1950, the wealthier countries of the world <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vowed </strong>to free the world of the disease. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pledged </strong>to supply the vaccine to any country that could not afford it. Scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>compiled </strong>lists of areas where the disease still thrived. Then doctors <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>diagnosed </strong>people who had the disease in these areas. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>enacted </strong>laws that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>prohibited </strong>people with smallpox from mixing with those who did not. In this way, they could not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>transmit </strong>the disease to others. Then the doctors gave all of them the vaccine.</p><p>It took a longtime and a lot of work. But nearly thirty years later, on December 9,1979, a group of scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>certified </strong>that smallpox had been successfully stopped. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>humane </strong>efforts of people from all over the world had accomplished a great task.</p>",

A severe health <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>hazard </strong>caused the outbreak. There was an extreme lack of clean drinking water in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>overcrowded </strong>urban cities. Garbage and chemicals got into the public water supplies and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>contaminated </strong>them. Since people did not have access to other sources, they had to drink the dirty water.</p><p>The outbreak spread rapidly and infected almost 16,000 people. The illness caused extreme pain in people&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>intestines</strong>. It also caused a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>deficiency </strong>of important fluids in sick people&rsquo;s bodies. Without the proper fluids and minerals, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>metabolic </strong>processes stopped working correctly. People were unable to digest food properly or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>replenish </strong>their lost nutrients. If they had not received <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>viable </strong>treatment, they would have been likely to die. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>imperative </strong>for help to come soon.</p><p>However, the government of Zimbabwe was unable to provide help to its people. The government didn&rsquo;t have a plan to stop the spread of cholera. In addition, the country was too poor to get clean water or medication for the sick. The people seemed to be doomed.</p><p>Luckily, many other countries recognized the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>paramount </strong>need to contain the outbreak. Dozens of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>voluntary</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>practitioners </strong>from Britain, France, the United States, and other countries went to Zimbabwe to treat the disease. Through the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>provision </strong>of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sterile </strong>drinking water and medication, people finally got the treatment they badly needed. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>compassionate </strong>doctors were able to save the lives of thousands. By January of 2009, the epidemic was almost completely contained.</p><p>Today, the Zimbabwean government is working with other countries to prevent future epidemics. They are cleaning up the water supply and learning how to avoid health hazards. The system used to filter water is being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>upgraded</strong>. The government now <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>administers </strong>the water supply plants and makes sure that they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>adhere </strong>to strict safety guidelines. Hopefully, future instances of cholera will be treated before they start deadly epidemics.</p>",

She knew that if she did not act quickly, the child&rsquo;s condition would <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>deteriorate</strong>.</p><p>She summoned the children&rsquo;s nurse and said to her, &ldquo;The monks make a medicine that can cure my child&rsquo;s sickness. Please, hurry tonight to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>monastery </strong>and get it.&rdquo;</p><p>The nurse immediately hurried from the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>manor </strong>to get the medicine. The monastery was far away by Rabbit <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>Cove</strong>, and there was no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>freeway</strong> leading to it. The only way there was to walk along a dark and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>winding </strong>trail.</p><p>The temperature was close to zero degrees <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>centigrade</strong>, and it was raining. Luckily, the nurse had grabbed her raincoat <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>beforehand</strong>. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>zipped </strong>it up and pulled the hood over her head.</p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;ll never make it there,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo; Perhaps I should return and go in the morning.&rdquo; But she remembered the sick child and decided to continue.</p><p>Finally, she arrived at the monastery. It was very late. She feared the monks would not be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>hospitable</strong>. But she approached the door and knocked anyway. The rain had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>condensed </strong>on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>exterior </strong>of the windows by the door. All she could see was the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>profile </strong>of a large man coming to answer the door. Again, she was filled with fear.</p><p>But the monk smiled at her when he opened the door. He took her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>outstretched </strong>hand and welcomed her with a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hearty </strong>voice. The place was warm, and she heard a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>concerto </strong>playing in another room. She relaxed.</p><p>&ldquo; How can I help you?&rdquo; the monk asked, and the nurse explained the situation.</p><p>He instantly knew what to do. He grabbed a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>parcel </strong>of medicine and took her back to the manor in a carriage. The medicine worked. The nurse was happy she had persevered through the bad weather and found the monastery. Now the boy would be able to live a long natural life.</p>",

That&rsquo;s because doctors in the 1800s were influenced more by <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>primal </strong>medical beliefs than science.</p><p>Rather than thinking the brain caused seizures, people in the 180&#39; still thought they were the result of strange forces. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>equated </strong>seizures with the work of evil spirits. Others felt that the seizures had a cosmic or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>lunar </strong>cause. They believed that the cycles of the moon and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>constellations </strong>could make someone have a seizure.</p><p>During a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>session </strong>to treat a patient who had seizures, doctors would force the patient to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>invoke </strong>the grace of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>Almighty</strong>. They thought if the patient did this, then the patient would rid themselves of the evil spirits causing the seizures.</p><p>The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>advent </strong>of modern <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>psychiatry </strong>occurred during the 1800s. At that time people who suffered from seizures were placed in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>psychiatric</strong> hospitals. They were treated like they were insane. However, none of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>outmoded </strong>treatments worked.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the late 1850s that the causes of seizures were understood. We know today that these causes <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>pertain </strong>to the brain. Misfired signals from the brain cause a jerking <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>reflex </strong>in the body. These usually occur when someone is very tired.</p><p>Once the causes of seizures were known, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>definitive </strong>treatments were developed. Today, treatments range from taking pills to having surgery. Treatment is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>personalized </strong>according to the type of seizure the patient has.</p><p>Even today, some people are unsure about seizures. Their most common mistake is thinking that a person having a seizure will swallow their tongue. They often shove some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>utensil </strong>in the person&rsquo;s mouth. However, this doesn&rsquo;t help. The utensil often blocks the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>airway </strong>and prevents the person from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>inhaling</strong>. Yet most of the public no longer fear people who have seizures. Instead, they can now help and comfort a person if they have a seizure.</p>",

He was scared and filled with doubt.</p><p>The empire had passed a new law stating that citizens could only use the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>imperial </strong>language. The editor disagreed with the law and decided to write an article about why it was wrong. He felt that the new law <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>excluded </strong>people of different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>nationalities </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>racial </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>ethnic </strong>backgrounds.

He called it the Ice House: a house made entirely of ice and snow. All of the beds, chairs, tables, and walls are cold, hard sculptures of ice.</p><p>A group of architects and volunteers from all over the world traveled to the site of the Ice House and began its construction. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>multicultural </strong>group journeyed through <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blizzards </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>frigid </strong>temperatures to reach the site. Once the builders arrived, there was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>interchange </strong>of ideas, and tools were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>allocated </strong>to each worker. An expert was selected to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>oversee </strong>the building process to make sure there was no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>discord </strong>between the workers. Once a plan was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>generated</strong>, they got right to work. The design was very unique; the builders couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>replicate </strong>the design from normal houses.</p><p>The first step was to build the walls and ceiling. The builders used a metal frame to help them build the structure. After the ice was in place, the frame was removed. The builders then created furniture and art pieces. Designs were carved into each piece. One worker carved big <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wavy </strong>lines, and another made tiny <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>clockwise</strong>, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>concentric </strong>circles. Finally, the workers carved small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>cavities </strong>in the roof and inserted colored lights. When the work was finished, the beautiful house was ready for a resident to enjoy.</p><p>Living in the Ice House is an experience like no other. Erik stores his belongings in an ice <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>locker </strong>and lays out a sleeping bag on his ice bed. At dinner, he dines on a delicious salad with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>crisp </strong>toppings. And for the main course, he enjoys <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>appetizing </strong>fish caught from a nearby river. The fish are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>pierced </strong>with icicles and served on ice plates. After dinner, he gets ready for a cold night. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>omission </strong>of heaters can be too much for his visitors sometimes. Luckily, there are warm rooms nearby, as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>courtesy </strong>to people who get too cold.</p>",

In just 50 years, the population will be almost 9 billion.</p><p>Many people worry that the Earth won&rsquo;t have enough resources to support so many people.

Also, cars and machines waste a ton of important natural resources like oil and water.

Even today, many people <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>subsist </strong>on mere <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>scraps </strong>of food and little water.

Even though they were very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>industrious</strong>, the weather became too cold outside to plant their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>staple </strong>food, rice. So what did they do? Since they had so much free time during the long, cold winters, the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>inventive </strong>farmers started performing tricks to entertain themselves. They used their farm tools and anything they could find to make their tricks more spectacular. They even twisted their bodies into crazy shapes and performed awesome jumps. Overtime, they became great <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acrobats</strong>, and their art form came to be known as &ldquo; Hundred Plays.&rdquo;</p><p>Hundred Plays involves doing many kinds of tricks. For example, in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Mandarin</strong>-speaking parts of China, performers do the lion dance. They wear costumes and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>mimic </strong>the animal&rsquo;s movements.

In other words, it teaches them to use their physical and mental strength together.</p><p>Since the art has its origins with poor farmers, rich people used to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>scorn </strong>acrobats. They thought acrobats were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>villains</strong>. The rich people thought the acrobats just wanted to trick them.

Arts <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>advocacy </strong>groups convinced the government to support Chinese acrobatics.

They would hide behind the door of the school <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>janitor</strong>&rsquo;s closet, then jump out to scare her. Once, a boy dressed up like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vampire </strong>and chased her down the street. Anne hated being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>constrained </strong>by her fears, but she didn&rsquo;t know how to be brave.</p><p>She was walking home from school one day when someone came up behind her. Before she could turn around, a powerful man grabbed her. She couldn&rsquo;t scream because a huge hand was put over her mouth. Anne knew that this could not be another <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stunt </strong>by her classmates. The scary man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>restrained </strong>her arms and legs and carried her to his house. He tied Anne to a chair. Her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>guts </strong>began to hurt because she was so scared.</p><p>The man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>prodded </strong>Anne with his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>forefinger </strong>and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay right here until I get a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>ransom </strong>from your parents.

A string of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>saliva </strong>hung from his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>moist </strong>lips. Anne was terrified and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>intimidated </strong>by the horrible man. But she knew she had to escape somehow.</p><p>Eventually, the man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>yawned</strong>. Anne waited quietly until he fell asleep. As he slept, she carefully wiggled her arms and legs until the ropes became loose. She slipped out of the ropes and carefully opened the door. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sprinted </strong>to the bus <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>depot </strong>and boarded a bus to the police station. She told the police what happened, and they arrested the kidnapper.</p><p>The kids at school were amazed. They asked her, &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you too scared to escape?&rdquo;</p><p>She said, &ldquo;<strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>Nope</strong>, I knew that I had to be brave and get out of there!&rdquo;</p><p>The kids were very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tolerant </strong>of Anne from then on.

At the border between two counties, he&rsquo;d have to pay a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>tariff </strong>on the cargo. However, he could keep his money if he avoided the station at the border. He worried about getting in trouble for not paying the tariff, but the thought of extra money <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>outweighed </strong>this concern.</p><p>He took out his road map. To his surprise, it <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>depicted </strong>a small road that had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dual </strong>advantage. It not only avoided the border station but also was a shorter route to the coast. He decided to take the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>shortcut</strong>.</p><p>However, along his journey, he soon ran into problems. First, he had to cross a small wooden bridge.

The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>thermometer </strong>read over 100 degrees <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>Fahrenheit</strong>. The truck&rsquo;s engine became too hot, so the driver parked it in the shade of a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>grove </strong>of trees until it cooled down.</p><p>Later, he took a wrong turn. He stopped and took out his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>binoculars</strong>. He scanned his surroundings and eventually discovered a landmark that led him back to the proper route.</p><p>Finally, he arrived at the pier, but the ship wasn&rsquo;t there. When he asked about the ship&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>whereabouts</strong>, a man said that it had left thirty minutes ago. He had not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>fulfilled </strong>his duty. He realized then the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>paradox </strong>of the shortcut. The shortest route can be the longest, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vice versa</strong>, a long route may be the fastest.</p>",

            "story": "<p>One morning, Lucas sat outside with his grandfather. They looked past the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>gravel </strong>road that led to a natural <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>reservoir </strong>on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>delta</strong>. On the other side of the water, there was a cottage.</p><p>&ldquo; Does a ghost live there?&rdquo; Lucas asked.</p><p>&ldquo; No, a mad hatter lives there,&rdquo; said his grandfather. Lucas didn&rsquo;t know what a mad hatter was, but the image of a scary man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>haunted </strong>him.</p><p>Later, Lucas went for a walk in the forest. He collected pieces of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>amber </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>granite </strong>that he found on the ground. He looked at the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>moss </strong>on the trees and watched a bird <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>peck </strong>at the ground. But the forest was like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>maze</strong>. Soon, Lucas was lost.</p><p>Lucas heard somebody behind him. He wanted to run away, but he fell. He had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>streak </strong>of blood on his shirt and some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>pebbles </strong>stuck in his skin. Then a man appeared.</p><p>&ldquo; I will take you home. First, let&rsquo;s get you cleaned up,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Lucas followed him. When they arrived at the cottage, he realized the man was the mad hatter!</p><p>He sat down inside. It smelled like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>charcoal</strong>, but it looked like a normal house. The man brought Lucas back some medicine.</p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s a bit old, but it&rsquo;s not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>expired</strong>,&rdquo; the man said.</p><p>While Lucas cleaned his cut, the man washed the blood out of his shirt with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>detergent</strong>.</p><p>Lucas asked, &ldquo;Are you a mad hatter?&rdquo;</p><p>The man laughed and replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>euphemism </strong>for a crazy person. Actually, I&rsquo;m pretty normal. I&rsquo;m a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>columnist </strong>fora newspaper,&rdquo; said the man. He pointed to his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>credentials </strong>which hung on the wall.</p><p>Lucas could hear the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>crickets </strong>outside. It was getting dark, so he asked, &ldquo;Could you take me home now?&rdquo;</p><p>The man said yes. Lucas was surprised that people thought the man was crazy. He was actually very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>courteous</strong>. Maybe Lucas should have a more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>liberal </strong>attitude. Next time, Lucas wouldn&rsquo;t make judgments about people without getting to know them first.</p>",
