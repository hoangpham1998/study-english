She knew that winter was coming and that there would soon be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dearth </strong>of food. So she decided to make gathering food for winter her primary job. Gathering food was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>grueling </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mundane </strong>activity, but Beth made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>deliberate </strong>effort because she knew that it was important. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>allotted </strong>herself a few hours every day to collect beans. By winter, she had collected a massive pile and hid them in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>cache</strong>.</p><p>Beth had a sister named Mary. Mary lacked ambition. She had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>fanciful </strong>ideas about how she would survive winter. She thought that food would just come to her and that she could work at her own <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>convenience</strong>. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>opted </strong>to spend the days playing and dancing, instead of gathering beans. When the final hours of autumn <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>elapsed</strong>, Mary had only a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>paltry </strong>amount of food stored away.</p><p>Mary realized that her food supply was too small to last through winter. She visited her sister. Mary said, &ldquo;Beth, lamina <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dire </strong>situation. I didn&rsquo;t gather enough food for winter. Will you let me share your beans? Please have some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>empathy </strong>for your sister!&rdquo;</p><p>Beth thought for a moment. Then she replied, &ldquo;Mary, I am truly sorry for you. But I will not give you any of my beans. Instead, I will let you have my empty bag. You can still work hard and gather enough food for the winter. It will be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tedious</strong>, but you will learn the value of hard work.&rdquo;</p><p>Beth&rsquo;s words <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>appalled </strong>Mary. Mary cried with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>outrage</strong>, &ldquo;There is too much work! I won&rsquo;t have any time to dance or play!&rdquo;</p><p>Beth said, &ldquo;It is crucial that you gather enough food. You must have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>sustenance </strong>before you have fun. Go now, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>rectify </strong>your situation.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>griped </strong>some more, but she knew that her sister was right. She took the bag and went to work gathering her own beans for the winter.</p>",

While he was cleaning, he had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>impulse </strong>to examine the fungus. He saw that whenever the fungus was in close <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>proximity </strong>to the bacteria, the bacteria died.</p><p>Though he was a messy scientist, his experiments were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>precise</strong>. He thought that there might be some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>significance </strong>to the fungus. He immediately <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>commenced </strong>an experiment to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>assess </strong>what had happened to the bacteria. It had either died by accident or the fungus had killed it. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>subsequent </strong>tests proved it was the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>latter </strong>reason.</p><p>What he found <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>astonished </strong>him. The fungus actually killed the bad bacteria. All this time, he had been looking for a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>synthetic </strong>material to kill the bacteria. Instead, a common fungus did the job.</p><p>He knew that something in the fungus had killed the bacteria. His next step was to find those <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>molecules </strong>that had done it. When he found them, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>extracted </strong>them and put them into a pill. The drug proved to be very effective. It also worked against other types of harmful bacteria.</p><p>The discovery received a lot of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>publicity</strong>. Soon after, the new drug was being used all over the world. Because of the success, the scientist was able to develop even more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fabulous </strong>drugs to help people. His accidental discovery changed the world and helped save many people&rsquo;s lives.</p>",

Many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>biographies </strong>have been written that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>narrate </strong>his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dominance </strong>in the music world. But do you know what really makes him special? Even though millions of people got to hear his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>multiple</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>masterpieces</strong>, he never did. Beethoven wrote his best pieces after he went completely deaf!</p><p>His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>partiality </strong>toward classical music developed when he was very young. He wasn&rsquo;t interested in anything else as a child. When he was five, he learned how to play the piano. From then, nothing could stop his passion for writing and playing music.</p><p>When Beethoven was twenty, he began to lose his hearing. He got <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acute</strong>, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>spontaneous </strong>pains in his ears. His hearing kept getting worse over time. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>inevitable </strong>that he would eventually lose it altogether. It was very hard for him to keep writing music. He lost the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>virtue </strong>of patience, and he became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>notorious </strong>for his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aggression</strong>. Still, he never stopped trying. His passion for music <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>compelled </strong>him to keep performing even after he went deaf. He couldn&rsquo;t hear himself play, but he knew that his creations sounded <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>gorgeous</strong>.</p><p>His final concert was held at a huge <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>banquet</strong>. He gave the musicians a cue, and they began to play. He directed the concert with all his heart. He couldn&rsquo;t hear the music, but he said that he could feel it. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>Overall</strong>, performance was one of the finest in history. When it was over, he turned to the crowd. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>clapped </strong>and cheered wildly. In that beautiful moment, the applause <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>boosted </strong>his emotions, and he began to cry.</p><p>In 1827, he suffered from lead poisoning. He didn&rsquo;t survive the sickness, but his music did because great music never becomes <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>outdated</strong>. Even though Beethoven is gone, his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>legacy </strong>will live on forever.</p>",

He thought about how important hearing is for blind people.</p><p>&ldquo;Could you pass me the newspaper, please?&rdquo; he asked. Just then, he remembered he couldn&rsquo;t see the words on the page. He wondered if <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>Braille </strong>newspapers were ever made.</p><p>After finishing breakfast, his brothers asked him to play soccer.

But the first written history of the device comes from China about 2,100 years ago. Scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>cite </strong>an ancient book that describes parachutes. However, there is no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>archeological </strong>evidence that proves that an actual parachute was ever made. Later, people from northern Africa and Italy also had ideas about a similar invention. In fact, a Leonardo Da Vinci&rsquo;s drawing <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>corresponds </strong>closely with the modern parachute design!</p><p>In 1783, French scientist Sebastian Lenormand invented the first modern parachute. Sebastian <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>brainstormed </strong>with other scientists to come up with a way to help people jump safely out of burning buildings. He thought the solution was to give people an object to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>restrict </strong>their speed while they traveled toward the ground. Many people thought that he was up to some kind of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>fraud</strong>, but Sebastian had a lot of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>integrity</strong>. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>budget </strong>was limited, so he first tested his theory by using two umbrellas. He jumped out of a tree and found that the umbrellas worked.</p><p>Next, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>refined </strong>his invention. Rather than using umbrellas, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>knit </strong>a large parachute. Finally, he jumped off a tall building on a French <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>estate </strong>and landed safely in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>courtyard</strong>.</p><p>Sebastian&rsquo;s work gave another man an idea. Jean-Pierre Blanchard had a different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>outlook </strong>than Sebastian. He was a hot air balloon <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>addict</strong>. He was one of the first people to ride in a hot air balloon powered by <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>hydrogen </strong>gas. He was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>proponent </strong>of using the parachutes to exit from hot air balloons. Starting in 1785, he used his dog to show that animals could land safely from hot air balloons by using parachutes. Then, in 1793, he was faced with a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>chaotic </strong>experience. The hot air balloon he was riding in burst and started to fall. He was forced to use a parachute himself. And much to his relief, it saved his life!</p>",

It was well known that this king would make <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>captives </strong>fight one another. This was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>commonplace </strong>during his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>reign</strong>. For these fights, the king had built several large <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>arenas</strong>. He often awarded the winners by setting them free or even having them join his elite army <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>corps</strong>.</p><p>The soldier, however, decided he had seen too much violence. He now felt that all life was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>sacred</strong>. The night before his first match, he made a risky decision. He decided that he would not engage in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>combat</strong>. He knew he may never be set free, but it was a decision that he was willing to accept.</p><p>In the morning, he was led from the prisoners&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>compound </strong>to one of the king&rsquo;s arenas. A gate coated in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>rust </strong>stood between him and the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>auditorium</strong>&rsquo;s floor. He was worried, but he knew what he had to do.</p><p>When the gate opened, he calmly walked to the center of the arena and sat. He started to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>meditate</strong>. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>foe </strong>Darius, who was skilled in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>realm</strong> of sword fighting and was typically not very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aggressive</strong>, would not fight the quiet soldier until he attacked Darius first.</p><p>Darius tried to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>provoke </strong>him by <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>hacking </strong>at the air close to his head with his sword. But the soldier was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>distracted</strong>. He sat quietly, as if he were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>dumb</strong>, and looked calmly up at the sky. Even when Darius <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>nicked </strong>him on the cheek with the edge of his sword, the soldier did not move.</p><p>At last he threw down his sword and shield and gave up. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fight someone who refuses to fight me!&rdquo; Darius shouted to the king.</p><p>The king was very impressed with the soldier. Never in any battle had he seen someone so brave. As a result, he gave the peaceful soldier <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>amnesty</strong>. The soldier&rsquo;s actions proved to the king and everyone in the arena that peace was more powerful than fighting.</p>",

Jack&rsquo;s job was to use a tiny <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>mechanism </strong>to get <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>nectar </strong>from flowers. The nectar was a main ingredient in the drugs. Jack liked his job, and he thought that Bioco was a caring company. However, Jack soon learned that the company wasn&rsquo;t as kind as he first thought.</p><p>Bioco&rsquo;s motto was &ldquo;Make the Earth a Better Place.&rdquo; However, this motto was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>deceptive</strong>. The company actually did a number of really bad things to the environment. The company produced a lot of smog and harmful <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acid</strong>. Bioco poured the acid in a nearby river, which caused <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>erosion </strong>and made fish <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>prone </strong>to illness.</p><p>After a few weeks at the new job, Jack saw all the bad things Bioco was doing. He had always had strong <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>ethics</strong>, and he knew he had to do something. One day, while the Bioco workers were eating in the cafeteria, Jack stood up and gave a speech. He said, &ldquo;My fellow coworkers, I know you have all seen the evil things our company is doing. I have a notion that we can fix them if we form a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>coalition</strong>. We can go to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>administration </strong>and tell them we&rsquo;ll quit if they don&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>eliminate </strong>the problems. They&rsquo;ll have no choice but to listen to us.&rdquo;</p><p>Jack explained what they were to do. His coworkers liked his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>explicit </strong>plan. They went to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>administrative </strong>offices and demanded that Bioco stop damaging the environment, or they all would quit. One supervisor said to them, &ldquo;Thank you for being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>straightforward </strong>about this issue. Since I can&rsquo;t afford to lose all of you workers, I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to fix things.&rdquo;</p><p>Jack, his supervisor, and his coworkers spent the next month designing a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>framework </strong>for the company. They cleaned up the acid from the river and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>minimized </strong>the amount of air pollution the company released. At last, the company motto became apt.</p>",

He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>flapped </strong>his wings and went high above the Earth. He flew over mountains, oceans, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>glaciers</strong>. After a while, his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>inward </strong>thoughts were no longer about falling. He was actually having fun! He began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>hum </strong>a song as he enjoyed the view. When he reached home, his tribe was there to greet him.</p><p>The chief said, &ldquo;On <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>behalf </strong>of the tribe, I declare you a man.

            "story": "<p>In 1954, a man named Richard was dying of kidney disease. He wouldn&rsquo;t survive for long unless he got a new kidney right away. Richard&rsquo;s twin brother, Robert, was willing to donate one of his kidneys to his dying brother. At the time, however, no doctor had ever performed a successful <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>internal </strong>organ <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>transplant</strong>. The idea of taking an organ out of one person and putting it into another was just a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>fantasy</strong>. But the brothers decided to be brave and found a doctor who could make organ transplants a reality.</p><p>Since Richard and Robert were twins, their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>heredity </strong>was identical. They had the exact same <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>biological </strong>traits. Even their kidneys were identical on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>cellular </strong>level. Therefore, Robert&rsquo;s working kidney could be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>substituted </strong>for Richard&rsquo;s bad one. Richard&rsquo;s body could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>adapt </strong>to the new organ if the operation was done correctly.</p><p>The twins went to Dr. Murray, who was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>pioneer </strong>of new surgical methods. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dynamic </strong>team of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>surgeons </strong>performed the transplant. Dr. Murray made sure his surgeons followed a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>rigid</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>sequence </strong>of directions so that no mistakes were made. First, they made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>minimal </strong>cut in Richard&rsquo;s side and removed the bad kidney. Then, they made another small cut in Robert&rsquo;s side, removed his kidney, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>transferred </strong>it into Richard&rsquo;s body. Finally, they sewed up the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>respective </strong>cuts. The entire operation only took about one hour.</p><p>After the surgery, it was clear that both brothers were going to be OK. The operation was confirmed a success. Richard&rsquo;s new kidney worked great! Doctors <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>prescribed </strong>medicine for the pain caused by the surgery. Since Richard was still weak, he used physical <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>therapy </strong>to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>revive </strong>his strength. At last, Richard&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>transition </strong>into a healthy, happy person was complete.</p><p>Dr. Murray became a hero in the medical world. His success gave other doctors confidence to try organ transplants themselves. Now, doctors perform life-saving transplants and surgeries every day.</p>",
