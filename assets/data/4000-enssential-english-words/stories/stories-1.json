But Joe&rsquo;s soccer team had a game.</p><p>Next, Tom went down the hall to Brad&rsquo;s room. Brad was reading a very large old book. &ldquo;Hi, Brad,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;Are you reading a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dictionary</strong>?

It&rsquo;s about <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>hidden </strong>gold in Adams County. It&rsquo;s more than a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>century </strong>old. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>published </strong>in 1870! Look, it even has the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>original </strong>cover on it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom asked, &ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from my dad&rsquo;s friend.

There are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>clues </strong>to it in this book. Let&rsquo;s find it!&rdquo; Looking for gold sounded like fun.</p><p>The first clue was to find a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>flat </strong>tree underground. &ldquo;It must be in the forest,&rdquo; Tom said.</p><p>Brad said, &ldquo;The flat tree could be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>board </strong>under the dirt. It could cover the gold.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom and Brad dug in the dirt all morning. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>process </strong>of looking for gold made them hungry. They were ready to stop for lunch. But then Brad hit something hard. It was a board!</p><p>Brad <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>pounded </strong>on the board until it broke. There was a small hole under it. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; He held up a gold coin.</p><p>Tom saw a piece of paper in the hole. &ldquo;Brad, there&rsquo;s more. It&rsquo;s a map to the rest of the gold!&rdquo;</p><p>Brad smiled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; And they hurried to find the wealth of Adams County.</p>",

He offered her the pig for one gold coin. That was a very small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>amount</strong>. Beth gave him the coin. He put it in his pocket. He walked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ahead </strong>of Beth to get the pig.</p><p>He gave her a closed bag and said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your pig.&rdquo; He then left very quickly.</p><p>Beth looked at the bag&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>surface</strong>. It was moving. She opened it to let the pig out. A cat was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>inside</strong>! &ldquo;He tricked me! That isn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>proper</strong>,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Later, the man returned to trick more people. Beth saw him and the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>memory </strong>of the cat came back. She told her friends. They stopped him. But no one knew what to do next.</p><p>Someone said, &ldquo;We need an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>independent </strong>and fair person to decide that.&rdquo; They went to the judge. Beth told him about the cat in the bag.</p><p>The judge asked, &ldquo;Is there <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>evidence</strong>? Can you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>demonstrate </strong>how he did it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look in his bag,&rdquo; said Beth. She opened it and let a cat out of the bag. They learned the man&rsquo;s secret, and he went to jail.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how the idiom &ldquo;let the cat out of the bag&rdquo; came to mean to tell a secret.</p>",
